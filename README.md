# pet-blob

An interactive digital pet app made on android studio. 
This project was made for my final lab demo for my introductory course in software-construction at UBC: CPSC 210.
The final version is still in progress, but you can name, feed and check the status of your pet so far. 

## Getting Started

Connect an android phone to your computer through a usb cable or download an emulator. Run app\src\main\java\com\example\project\ui\StartActivity to install the app.
